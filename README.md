# 📊 End-to-End Business Intelligence Project | Brazil E-commerce Analytics

This project simulates a corporate Business Intelligence environment using the Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset provided by Olist.

It replicates a real analytical workflow: loading raw CSV files into a local SQL Server database, transforming transactional data using SQL, and developing an executive dashboard in Power BI for performance analysis.

## 🗄 Data Source

Dataset: Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist    
Reference: https://doi.org/10.34740/kaggle/dsv/195341 

To simulate a real corporate environment:

- Raw CSV files were imported into a local Microsoft SQL Server database.
- A structured relational model was created.
- SQL transformations were applied to build an analytical fact table at order-item level.
- The dataset was optimized for executive reporting in Power BI.

This approach mirrors enterprise BI workflows where analytical models are built directly from relational databases.

📅 Period analyzed: January 2017 – August 2018
(Orders prior to 2017 were excluded due to negligible transaction volume.)

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

The report is structured into two main analytical pages.

### 🔹 Shared KPIs (Available in Both Pages)

The following core metrics are displayed consistently across both dashboards:

- Total Revenue
- Revenue (Sales)
- Revenue (Shipping)

These KPIs provide a unified performance reference across different analytical perspectives.
